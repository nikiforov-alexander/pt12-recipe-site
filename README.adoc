[[task-1]]
=== Task 1

Create model classes, DAO interfaces, services,
and add unit tests to components.
Determine test coverage using a code coverage tool
and ensure your tests cover of at least 60% of your code.

---

Model classes created are:

* {Ingredient}
* {Item}
* {Owner}
* {Recipe}
* {Role}
* {Step}
* {User}

Some of them inherit {BaseEntity}, which is the [java]`@MappedSuperClass`
that has [java]`@Id id` and [java]`@Version version` fields, that are
repeated in child classes.

{RecipeCategory} enum is used in {Recipe} class as [java]`@Enumerated` field.

DAO interfaces are created as Spring-Data [java]`CrudRepository`-ies:

* {IngredientDao}
* {ItemDao}
* Recipe related DAOs:
** {RecipeDao}
** {FavoriteRecipesDao}
** {RecipeDaoImpl}
* User related DAOs:
** {OwnerDao}
** {RoleDao}
** {StepDao}
** {UserDao}

All {User} related DAOs are not exposed to REST API.

{FavoriteRecipesDao} is interface that allows us to add custom
methods to Spring-Data DAOs. And {RecipeDaoImpl} is the class that
implements {FavoriteRecipesDao} and defines manually defined
methods (For now only method listing favorite recipes for user).

Service layer implementations do not have anything in particular,
except repeating commands at DAO layer:

Most of them repeat commands at DAO layer with few exceptions:

Coverage report is in gzipped file called
link:./misc/coverage-report.tar.gz[coverage-report.tar.gz].

=== Task 2
Using the supplied files, create the template for the recipe list page.
Use the following requirements list to ensure all functionality
is included in the recipe list page.

Recipes:

. Displays a list of recipes by name and indicates
    with a heart icon whether a user has favorited the recipe
. Allows the user to filter the list by the selected category
. Allows the user to add a new recipe
. A user must have an account
. Allows the user to edit or delete a recipe
. A user must own the recipe

---

. Displays a list of recipes by name and indicates
with a heart icon whether a user has favorited the recipe
+
Recipes are displayed at the main page with the address
+
```
http://localhost:8080/
http://localhost:8080/recipes
http://localhost:8080/recipes/
```
+
{IndexRedirectController} takes care of redirecting from
both "/" and "/recipes" pages to "/recipes/" that is mapped
in {RecipeController}. There is probably a better way. But
I'll leave it for now as is. The functionality is tested in
{IndexRedirectControllerTest}
+
In order to show whether recipe is favorite for user we
generate [java]`List<Recipe> favoriteRecipesWithNullsForNonFavorites`
that has exactly the same
size as all recipes printed, but on the places where
recipe is favorite for user, it contains recipe, and
elsewhere is [java]`null`. This list is passed along with all recipes
to [java]`Model`.
+
The list to be passed is generate in a
[java]`RecipeController.generateFavoritesWithNullsForNonFavoritesList`
method. And because of that is tested separately in
`@Test favoritesWithNonNullsListIsGeneratedCorrectly` in
{RecipeControllerTest}
+
Simple list with favorite recipes for users is generated at DAO
level at customized {RecipeDaoImpl} using simple SQL query. It was
rather problematic for me to write Spring Query in annotation to
some method in {RecipeDao}, that is why I decided to make custom
implementation for now.
+
This can be done in many different ways, but I decided to leave it so.
